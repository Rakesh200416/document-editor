You are a senior frontend engineer building a production-ready rich text editor.

TASK:
Build a FRONTEND-ONLY document editor with real-time pagination using Tiptap, similar to Microsoft Word / Google Docs page layout.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Backend is NOT required
- Focus ONLY on frontend logic and UI
- Code must be clean, readable, and production-ready
- Follow all mandatory requirements listed below
- Assume this is a take-home assignment for a product company

TECH STACK (MANDATORY):
- Next.js (App Router preferred)
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Tiptap editor (@tiptap/react)

EDITOR REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY):
Implement a rich text editor with toolbar tools similar to MS Word, including:
- Paragraph text
- Headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Bold
- Italic
- Underline
- Strike-through
- Bullet list
- Numbered list
- Text alignment (left, center, right, justify)
- Undo / Redo
- Clear formatting
- Proper spacing and line-height handling

PAGINATION REQUIREMENTS (CORE TASK):
- Display visual page boundaries inside the editor
- Pages must look like real paper pages (white background, subtle shadow)
- Pages must update dynamically as the user types, deletes, or pastes content
- Page breaks must move automatically
- Pages must be stacked vertically like MS Word / Google Docs

PRINT ACCURACY (MANDATORY):
- Page size: US Letter (8.5 x 11 inches)
- Margins: 1 inch on all sides
- Convert inches to pixels correctly (assume 96 DPI)
- What the user sees in the editor must match printed output exactly

PAGINATION LOGIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Measure rendered DOM content height dynamically
- Calculate how much content fits per page
- Insert visual page breaks when content exceeds page height
- Recalculate pagination on every editor update
- Handle:
  - Mixed content (headings + paragraphs + lists)
  - Different font sizes and line heights
  - Editing content in the middle of the document
  - Long paragraphs that span multiple pages (gracefully)

DESIGN & UX REQUIREMENTS:
- Each page should look like a real document page
- Clear visual separation between pages
- Smooth scrolling
- Clean, minimal UI
- Toolbar fixed at top (Word-like experience)

PDF & PRINT FEATURES (FRONTEND-ONLY):
- Add "Print" and "Export to PDF" options in the toolbar
- Ensure exported PDF matches editor layout exactly
- Use client-side libraries only (e.g., html2pdf.js, jsPDF, or browser print)
- Maintain US Letter size and margins in PDF output
- No backend or server-side rendering allowed

CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Use reusable React components
- Use proper hooks (useEffect, useRef, useCallback)
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Comment complex logic (especially pagination and measurement)
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling (no inline CSS)

DELIVERABLES EXPECTED IN CODE:
- Next.js project structure
- Tiptap editor setup with required extensions
- Pagination calculation logic
- Page container component
- Toolbar component (with editor + print + PDF controls)
- Print-specific CSS (if required)
- Clear separation of concerns

DOCUMENTATION (IMPORTANT):
Include a README.md that explains:
1. How pagination is calculated using DOM measurements
2. How page size and margins are handled
3. How print and PDF export maintain layout accuracy
4. Trade-offs and limitations
5. What could be improved with more time

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Provide full frontend code
- Provide explanations only where necessary
- No backend code
- No placeholders like "implement later"

GOAL:
The final result should feel like a simplified Microsoft Word editor running in the browser, with real-time pagination and accurate print/PDF output.
