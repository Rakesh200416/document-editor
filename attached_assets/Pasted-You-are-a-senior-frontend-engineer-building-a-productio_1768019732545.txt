You are a senior frontend engineer building a production-ready rich text editor.

TASK:
Build a FRONTEND-ONLY Tiptap-based document editor with real-time pagination, similar to Microsoft Word / Google Docs, ensuring the editor view, print output, and PDF export are perfectly aligned.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Backend is NOT required
- Focus ONLY on frontend logic and UI
- Code must be clean, readable, and production-ready
- Treat this as a real take-home assignment for a product company
- Do NOT use placeholder implementations

TECH STACK (MANDATORY):
- Next.js (App Router preferred)
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Tiptap editor (@tiptap/react)

EDITOR FEATURES (MANDATORY):
Implement a Word-like toolbar supporting:
- Paragraph text
- Headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Bold, Italic, Underline, Strike-through
- Bullet lists and numbered lists
- Text alignment (left, center, right, justify)
- Font size selector
- Font family selector
- Text color and highlight
- Link insertion
- Undo / Redo
- Clear formatting
- Proper spacing and line-height handling

CORE PAGINATION REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Pages must be visually visible INSIDE the editor while typing
- Pages must look like real paper sheets (white background, subtle shadow)
- Page breaks must update dynamically on:
  - typing
  - deleting
  - pasting
  - editing in the middle of the document
- Pages must stack vertically like MS Word / Google Docs
- Page breaks must NOT appear as editable text
- Page boundaries must be layout elements only (non-editable)

PRINT & LAYOUT ACCURACY (MANDATORY):
- Page size: US Letter (8.5 x 11 inches)
- Margins: exactly 1 inch on all sides
- Assume 96 DPI for inch-to-pixel conversion
- Editor layout must match print and PDF output exactly
- What the user sees in the editor must be identical to what prints

PAGINATION LOGIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Measure rendered DOM content height dynamically
- Calculate available content height per page
- Automatically flow content across pages
- Handle:
  - Mixed content types (headings, paragraphs, lists)
  - Different font sizes and line heights
  - Long paragraphs spanning multiple pages
  - Content reflow when editing mid-document
- Pagination must recalculate on every editor update

HEADER, FOOTER & PAGE NUMBERING (ADDED REQUIREMENT):
- Add support for a fixed header and footer on every page
- Header and footer must NOT be editable content
- Footer must display dynamic page numbers (e.g., “Page 1 of 5”)
- Header, footer, and page numbers must appear:
  - In the editor view
  - In print output
  - In exported PDF

PDF EXPORT & PRINT (FRONTEND-ONLY):
- Add toolbar actions:
  - Print
  - Export to PDF
- Use client-side only libraries (e.g., html2pdf.js or equivalent)
- Ensure exported PDF:
  - Uses US Letter size
  - Has correct margins
  - Preserves pagination, header, footer, and page numbers
- PDF layout must exactly match the editor view
- No backend or server-side rendering allowed

DESIGN & UX REQUIREMENTS:
- Minimalist, Google Docs–style UI
- Neutral gray color scheme
- Light mode only
- Clean, distraction-free layout
- Smooth scrolling between pages
- Toolbar fixed at the top

CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Modular, reusable React components
- Proper use of hooks (useEffect, useRef, useCallback)
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Clear comments for complex logic (pagination, measurement)
- Tailwind CSS only (no inline styles)

DELIVERABLES EXPECTED IN CODE:
- Next.js project structure
- Tiptap editor configuration with required extensions
- Page container component (fixed-size pages)
- Header and footer components
- Pagination calculation logic
- Toolbar component with formatting + print/PDF actions
- Print-specific CSS rules

DOCUMENTATION (MANDATORY):
Include a README.md explaining:
1. How real-time pagination is calculated using DOM measurement
2. How page size and margins are enforced
3. How editor, print, and PDF outputs stay in sync
4. Why page breaks are layout elements, not document content
5. Trade-offs and known limitations
6. What could be improved with more time

GOAL:
The final result should feel like a simplified Microsoft Word editor running in the browser, where users can see exact page boundaries while typing and export perfectly formatted legal documents as PDF.
